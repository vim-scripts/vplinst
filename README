Vplinst stands for "VIM plugin installer" and is an attempt to make an automatic plugin installer for Vim. It installs scripts distributed in various different manners: vba (VimBall), tgz, .vim, .zip. You just configure the scripts you want in the vplinst.conf file, run the script and it will download and install them for you.

This utility consists in awk and sh scripts, that almost match POSIX and may run in any UNIX operating system with /bin/sh and awk.
